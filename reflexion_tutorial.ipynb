    "\n",
    "The critic evaluates content on multiple dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"overall_score\": 7.5,           # Composite score (0-10)\n",

    "  \"structure_score\": 7.0,         # Is it well-organized?\n",
    "  \"engagement_score\": 7.5,        # Is it interesting?\n",
    "  \"completeness_score\": 7.0,      # Does it cover the topic?\n",

    "  \"weaknesses\": [\"Weak intro\", \"Missing conclusion\"],\n",
    "  \"specific_improvements\": \"Add a stronger hook in the introduction...\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why multiple scores?**\n",

    "- Helps identify specific areas to improve\n",
    "- Prevents generic \"make it better\" critiques\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **The Critique Prompt**\n",
    "\n",
    "We ask the LLM to be a **structured critic**:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "critique_prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "You are a content quality critic. Evaluate this content:\n",
    "\n",
    "{current_content}\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate on these criteria (rate 0-10 for each):\n",
    "1. Clarity - Is it easy to understand?\n",
    "2. Structure - Is it well-organized?\n",
    "3. Engagement - Is it interesting to read?\n",
    "4. Completeness - Does it cover the topic well?\n",
    "5. Accuracy - Is the information correct?\n",

    "The editor receives the critique and improves specifically:\n",

    "revision_task = f\"\"\"\n",

    "- Use Hybrid to gather data, then Reflexion to create report\n",
    "- Chain workflows for complex multi-phase tasks\n",

    "**Extend the pattern:**\n",
    "- Add human-in-the-loop critique\n",
    "- Implement multi-agent debate (multiple critics)\n",
    "- Track quality metrics over many runs\n",
    "- Build domain-specific evaluation criteria\n",
